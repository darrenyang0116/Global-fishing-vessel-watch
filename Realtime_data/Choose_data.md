Here is a list of possible data candidates about vessel location:

* [Global Fishing Watch source 1](http://globalfishingwatch.io/)
* [Global Fishing Watch source 2](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/treniformis/tree/0.1/treniformis/_assets/GFW/FISHING_MMSI/KNOWN_AND_LIKELY)
* [Marine Traffic](https://www.marinetraffic.com/), one of the major data source of Global Fishing Watch  
* [My Ship Tracking](http://www.myshiptracking.com/)
* [Fishing Vessel Finder](http://www.fao.org/figis/vrmf/finder/search/#.WRDlEonyu9Z)

Ohter ocean datasets that are less relevant to vessel location.
* [Ocean Health Index](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/)
* [Ocean Biogeographic Information System](http://www.iobis.org)


Ideally, I would like to use the dataset from [Marine Traffic](https://www.marinetraffic.com/), because it provides the most data points among the candidates.

However, it costs a lot of money if I need access to a completed set of data.

I ended up choosing [My Ship Tracking](http://www.myshiptracking.com/). This website provides certain amount of vessels ducking in the ports. Although this is not the most ideal dataset I was looking for, I can still use it to demonstrate how to build a website that visualizes the real-time vessel locations.

## Intent

In order to raise the awareness of global illegal fishing activities and provide evidence for law enforcement to prevent the violation of fishing regulation, this data visualization project dedicates to revealing the near-real time records of fishing vessel entering No-Take Marine Protected Areas and those vessels' country of origin.

The website enables users to look up suspicious fishing vessels by countries, including their own, and track the record of vessel violation.

## What is different between existing tools and this website?

While some website, like [Global Fishing Watch](http://globalfishingwatch.org/), has provided broad dataset of near-real time fishing vessel location on the ocean, this webiste solely focuses on data-visualization of suspicious fishing activity in No-take zone to help general audience monitoring illegal fishing activities.

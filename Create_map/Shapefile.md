## Sourcing shapefiles
We need a vector file to create an interactive map. [Shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) format can spatially describe vector features: points, lines, and polygons, representing. Each item usually has attributes that describe it, such as country or capital city.

You can easily search online for shapefiles and there are many free resources for pulling down high quality ones, we use [Natural Earth Data](http://www.naturalearthdata.com) to find the worldmap we want. You can also preview the shapefile you downloaded in [mapshaper](http://mapshaper.org).

The [next step](D3.md) is use [D3](https://d3js.org) to draw the worldmap with the file we just downloaded.

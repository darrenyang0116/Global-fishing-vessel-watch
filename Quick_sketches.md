## Quick sketches before building the website
It is always helpful to sckech out the data-visualization first before building the whole website. I created 2 sketchs by Illustrator and two animations by Hype to show how I envision the website's look and features.

## Static maps
This map shows suspicious India fishing vessels and their historical traces in a given period of time.

## Animations
[Animation 1](http://i.imgur.com/dERmhyF.gifv) shows user selecting a country and see its fishing vessels operating in No-take zone in a given period of time.

[Animation 2](http://i.imgur.com/zdpIPS8.gifv) uses color gradient to show fishing vessel violation over time by country and No-take zone.

In the next step, I will explain the detail about how to [create a worldmap](Create_map).

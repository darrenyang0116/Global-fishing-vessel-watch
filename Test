## Intent

In order to raise the awareness of global illegal fishing activities and provide evidence for law enforcement to prevent the violation of fishing regulation, I created a [data-visualization website](http://www.chyangdesign.com/) which is dedicated to revealing the real-time data of fishing vessels location and monitoring any illegal activity near No-take Marine Protected Areas. The website also enables users to look up suspicious fishing vessels by countries, including their own, and history record.


## What is different between existing tools and this data-visualization website?

While some website, like [Global Fishing Watch](http://globalfishingwatch.org/), has provided broad dataset of near-real time fishing vessel location on the ocean, this webiste solely focuses on data-visualization of suspicious fishing activity in No-take zone to help general audience monitoring illegal fishing activities.
